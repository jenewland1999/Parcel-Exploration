  "description": "A first-look at a immerging technology called Parcel. This technology is a smart zero-configuration web application bundler. It removes the need for any configuration unlike its competitors like Webpack or Bower making it well-liked by the community. Going forward this will likely be a widely-used technology and as such I've taken the time to look into it and create this small boilerplate project using it.",
